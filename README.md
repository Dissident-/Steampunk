Steampunk
=======

Steampunk (working name) is a browser game, using PHPixie and JQuery to be a bit more modern.

Inspired by Nexus War, Urban Dead, Nexus Clash, Quarantine2019 and Shintolin, Steampunk aims to be... something something something.

The main principles of Steampunk:

* If it is cool, it is in the game
* Prepare for terrible lore full of puns
* Open development, so the game can be resilient to developers leaving
* Administration should be clear and transparent


Potential premise:

A technically advanced society once existed on this world. The circumstances of their disappearance are unknown, but they have polluted large chunks of the landscape. Some parts are untouched lush forest, while others are barren wasteland.

Technology has progressed to an approximate medieval era, with bits of industrial age mixed in. Nobody truly understands the ancient relics of old, but they are amazing, unique and awesome (*cough cough* one off special legendary items that rotate around the playerbase).

Guns are fairly ineffective and mostly laughed at. People mostly fight with swords, bows, steam-swords (steamsabers? don't sue me!). Mechanical contraptions are quite impressive, but also liable to spontaneously combust.

They say the legendary hatblade can only be obtained by duelling its current owner. Will you defeat the master gentleman, doffer of hats most lethal and grandiose?
